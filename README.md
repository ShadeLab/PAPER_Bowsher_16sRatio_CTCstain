# PAPER_Bowsher_16sRatio_CTCstain
This is the repository of materials for a manuscript by Bowsher, Kearns, and Shade (2018) submitted to mSystems.

The objective of the manuscript is to explore factors underlying the calculation and interpretation of 16s rRNA:rRNA gene ratios, and to directly compare estimates of activity of microbial communities in soil using 16S ratios and CTC-based cell staining.

We conducted two separate experiments (‘corn rhizosphere soil’ and ‘bean rhizosphere soil’) in two rhizosphere soil types, subjecting each soil to varying types of stress.
