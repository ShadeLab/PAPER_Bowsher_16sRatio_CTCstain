The objective of the manuscript is to explore factors underlying the calculation and interpretation of 16s rRNA:rRNA gene ratios, and to directly compare estimates of activity of microbial communities in soil using 16S ratios and CTC-based cell staining.

We conducted two separate experiments (‘corn-associated soil’ and ‘bean rhizosphere soil’).
